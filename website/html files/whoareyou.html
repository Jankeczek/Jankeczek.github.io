                <h3>Hobby?</h3>
                I am currently a <i>learning</i> programmer <span class="gr">(hey, what did you expect from a trans girl?)</span>, 
                <br>these are the languages I'm currently learning:
                <ul>
                    <li> GDScript (Godot, Hobby)                                                                        </li>
                    <li> Python (School, <span class="linetr">Hobby</span>)                                             </li>
                    <li> C (Arduino, School)                                                                            </li>

                    <li class="gr"> <span class="linetr">C#</span> (discontinued as I dont use Unity anymore)           </li>
                    <li> HTML <span class="gr">(if you can call that a programming language)</span> and CSS (School)    </li>

                <br><h3>Games?</h3>
                <p>Games? What Games do I play?
                <br>Well, the last game that I played while writing this website was Martial Law <span class="gr">(free game on steam about communism in Poland)</span>,
                <br>and Awaria <span class="gr">(Peak game made by the guy who created Helltaker, it's free on steam so go play it NOW)</span>,
                <br>I 100% Awaria, got the cupcake recipe, and actually baked the cupcakes <span class="gr">(I <i id="gi">REALLY</i> like baking and cooking)</span>
                <br><br><img src="../images/cupcake1.jpg" id="cupcake1" alt="me making the dough for the cupcakes" title="me making the dough for the cupcakes"><img src="../images/cupcake2.jpg" id="cupcake2" alt="cupcakes baking in the oven" title="cupcakes baking in the oven">
                <br><p>apart from that I'm currently 100%'ing Celeste <span class="gr">(again, who would've guessed)</span>,
                <br>I like playing Minecraft or Lethal Company with my friens every now and then,
                <br>and when I'm bored I typically either binge watch youtube, or play 
                <br>sandbox games like PPG, GMod, S&Box, Brick Rigs, Colony Survival, or ETS2.</p>

                <br>In a leaderboard out of the games I mentioned <span class="gr">(only those that I own on steam)</span>
                <br>these are the ones I played the most <span class="gr">(the higher the game is the more hours I have in it)</span>:
