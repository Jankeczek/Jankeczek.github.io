                <h3>Who are you??</h3>
                <p>I'm glad you asked, name's Maja, also known as "Theâ„¢ J", or just "J"
                <br><span class="gr">though I mostly don't use that nickname anymore</span>,
                <br>but you can call me Majka, or Majcia :3.</p>
                <p>I'm a  <18  year old bisexual trans girl <span class="gr">(she/her (who would've guessed))</span>
                <br>interested in computers <span class="gr">(who would've guessed)</span>.
                <br>Also, I'm from Poland <span class="gr">(again, who would've guessed)</span>.</p>
                As every trans girl that exists <span class="sg">(sarcasm)</span>, I like programming,
                <br>out of all the programming languages that exist - I'm currently learning: 
                <ul>
                    <li> GDScript [Godot, Hobby]                                                                </li>
                    <li> Python [School, <span class="linetr">Hobby</span>]                                     </li>
                    <li> C [Arduino, School]                                                                    </li>
                    <li> C++ [School]                                                                           </li>
                    <li class="gr"> <span class="linetr">C#</span> [discontinued as I don't use Unity anymore]   </li>

                <p>In general I like/am interested in a lot of stuff, for example, what you might not expect, is that 
                <br>I Fucking. LOVE. <i>PUBLIC. <b>TRANPORT.</b></i> - Please give me as much trams and buses and trains and Oh God. I love them.</p>
                <p>On another note - I also like practically everything connected to computers.
                <br>Programming? âœ… The inner workings of computers <span class="sg">(I forgot what it's named in English ðŸ˜­)</span>? âœ… Operating systems? âœ…
                <br>How the internet works? âœ… If you told me something about computers I'd probably get more or less interested int it.</p>
                <p>If you were to ask me, what song do I like the most, it'd probably be <b>"DÅ‚ugoÅ›Ä‡ DzwiÄ™ku SamotnoÅ›ci"</b> by <span class="ziulty">Myslovitz</span>,
                <br>but if you were to ask me what music artist do I like the most, it'd probably be either <span class="czerwowy">Lady Pank</span> or <span class="ziulty">Myslovitz</span>.
